# Installation

### 1. Install the RetroFlow VPK's.

Install the [latest version of RetroFlow](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher/releases) and additional RetroFlow Adrenaline launcher VPK from [here](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher/releases).

'RetroFlow Launcher' is the app you will use to browse games. 'RetroFlow Adrenaline launcher' is needed for launching Playstation and PSP games.

### 2. Rename your PSP games using the steps below.

Renaming is needed for cover matching. RetroFlow will look for a title ID in the filename.

#### Windows users:

Please rename PSP ISO and CSO files using Leecherman's [PSP ISO Renamer tool](https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/PSPISORenamer) using the following parameters:

    %NAME% (%REGION%) [%ID%]

The result should look like this (please notice the square brackets):

    Cars 2 (US) [UCUS-98766].iso

Games can also be named with just the title ID like so: "UCUS98766.iso" but this isn't recommended.

#### Mac users:
See the FAQ's section for a guide on [renaming on a mac](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher#im-on-a-mac-how-do-i-rename-psp-games).


More information on PSP and Playstation after the FAQ's section.


### 3. Check your PS1 and PSP are in the right folders

PS1 and PSP games with eboot files should be saved here:

    ux0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/


PSP ISO and CSO games should be saved here: 

    ux0:pspemu/ISO/

uma0 can also be used.

### 4. Add your retro games to RetroFlow

**Option 1 - Use the default folders:**
Launch RetroFlow for the first time, RetroFlow will create the folders where you can save your games.

Once it's finshed loading; close RetroFlow and copy your favourite retro games into the relevant subfolders below:

    ux0:/data/RetroFlow/ROMS/

For PC Engine CD and TurboGrafx-CD RetroFlow will look for '.cue' files for these CD systems. Please make sure all the games are loose with the system's rom folder with .cue files.

For Dreamcast '.gdi' and '.cdi' games are supported.

**Option 2 - Use your own  game folders:**
If you don't want to save your games in the RetroFlow data folder, you can use your own directories.

Go to 'Scan settings' and then 'Edit game directories' to change the path to game folders.

Once you are done, select 'Rescan' to find the games.

**Tip:**
It's important that your roms are named using the no-intro file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)" , otherwise cover images won't be found.

### 5. Rescan to find your games

Press 'Start' and go to 'Scan Settings', then select 'Rescan'
Your retro games should now appear when you restart the app.
'Startup scan' can be turned off once you have finished adding your games, the app will startup faster when it's turned off.


### 6. Download covers & backgrounds

To download cover images, press start, then choose which covers or backgrounds you would like to download. 


# Issues loading games with Adrenaline?

Please try installing [AdrBubbleBooterInstaller](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/307).
Or try installing [Adrenaline Bubble Manager](https://github.com/ONElua/AdrenalineBubbleManager/releases) to check bubbles load okay.


# Possible incompatabilities

### Repatch
Potential issue with repatch / repatch_4 plugins in the tai config. May cause the Vita to shutdown. Try disabling these if you encounter an issue.

### PSP Categories lite
Unsupported, if you're experiencing please try without the plugin.

# RetroFlow FAQ's

### I'm on a Mac, how do I rename PSP games?
You can use the [UMD FileRenamer app here](https://github.com/BrosMakingSoftware/UMD_FileRenamer/releases/tag/v1.0).

Step 1. Download the UMD FileRenamer app above
Open the 'UMD_FileRenamer-1.0.jar' file and select your folder of games, then rename.

Step 2. Replace (parenthesis) with [brackets]
In the finder, select all the games, right click and select 'rename items'.
Replace the opening and closing parenthesis with square brackets instead.

    Name (XXXX-XXXXX).iso

Will be renamed to:

    Name [XXXX-XXXXX].iso

The game names will be missing the region code, but it's not required for the RetroFlow to work.


### Can I use HexFlow too?
Yes; RetroFlow is seperate, it uses different folders and a different title ID.

### Do I need to create bubbles for games?
No; RetroFlow doesn't need bubbles for games.

### Missing artwork - How should I name my games so covers are found?
It's recommended that your roms are named using the no-intro file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)" , these names are used to match with cover images.

You can manually download artwork, or rename your games to match the filenames in the [covers repo](https://github.com/jimbob4000/hexflow-covers). 


### Some systems aren't showing?
Empty collections are hidden by default, once you add some games into the roms folder, they will appear.

### Can I change the Mega Drive name to Genesis?
Sure; changing your language to 'English - American' will change the 'Mega Drive' name and logo to 'Genesis'.

### Can I change a core for RetroArch?
The cores have been set by system and cannot be changed on a game-by-game basis at the moment.

To change the core for an entire system, search for "Retroarch Cores" in the file below and edit the core file names accordingly. 

    ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua

The RetroArch core files can be found here: "ux0:/app/RETROVITA/"



### Can I change the rom folder locations?
Yes, from version 4.0 onwards.
Go to 'Scan settings' and then 'Edit game directories' to change the path to game folders.


# Adding PSP and Playstation games

RetroFlow uses the game ID's for Playstation and PSP for cover matching.
Please use the guides below.

## PSP
For PSP ISO and CSO files please rename using Leecherman's [PSP ISO Renamer tool](https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/PSPISORenamer) using the following parameters:

    %NAME% (%REGION%) [%ID%]

The result should look like this:

    Cars 2 (US) [UCUS-98766].iso

RetroFlow uses the ID to match artwork, and tidies the rest of the filename to display in the app.
CSO files are also supported, and should be named as above.

## Playstation
For PSX2PSP, game folder name must match with the GameID. For example:

    ux0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/**SLES01234**

Games will need to be in a EBOOT format, see here for information on [how to convert PSX Disc Images to EBOOT for PSP](https://www.cfwaifu.com/psx2psp/).
RetroFlow also uses the ID to lookup the name of the game.



# Custom Game Covers & Game Backgrounds

Place your custom covers in the game system's here "_ux0:/data/RetroFlow/COVERS/_"

Place your custom game backgrounds in the game system's here "_ux0:/data/RetroFlow/BACKGROUNDS/_"

Cover and background images must be in **png** format. For Vita, PSP, PSX games and Homebrew the The cover image file name must match the **Game ID** or the **Game Name** of each app. For roms the cover image name should match the **Rom Name** i.e. "Game Name (USA).png". The recommended resolution for Vita covers is 250x320px. [Sample image](https://live.staticflickr.com/7176/6885249717_738e8ee187_n.jpg)
