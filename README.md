* Also install the 'RetroFlow Adrenaline launcher' VPK from the [latest version of RetroFlow](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher/releases).
* 'RetroFlow Launcher' is the app you will use to browse games. 'RetroFlow Adrenaline launcher' is needed for launching Playstation and PSP games.

## 3. Check your PS1 and PSP are in the right Adrenaline folders


* PS1 and PSP games with eboot files should be saved here: `ux0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/`
* PSP ISO and CSO games should be saved here: `ux0:pspemu/ISO/`
* uma0, ur0, imc0 and xmc0 partitions are also supported.
* The partition you use for Adrenaline will also need to be selected in the 'Scan settings' in RetroFlow.
* **Tip:** PS1 games can also be launched using RetroArch, helpful for games which don't run well in Adrenaline.

## 4. Add your retro games to RetroFlow

For best results it's recommended that your games are named using the **no-intro** file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)", these names are used to download matching cover images.

#### Option 1 - Use the default folders

* Launch RetroFlow for the first time, RetroFlow will create the folders where you can save your games.
* Once it's finshed loading; close RetroFlow and copy or move your favourite retro games into the relevant game subfolders here: `ux0:/data/RetroFlow/ROMS/`

#### Option 2 - Use your own  game folders

* If you don't want to save your games in the RetroFlow data folder, you can use your own directories.
* Go to 'Scan settings' and then 'Edit game directories' to change the path to game folders.
* Once you are done, select 'Rescan' to find the games.

#### Disc based games

 * PC Engine CD and TurboGrafx-CD: RetroFlow will look for '.cue' files for these CD systems. Please make sure all the games are loose with the system's rom folder with .cue files.
 * Dreamcast:  '.gdi' and '.cdi' games are supported.
 * PS1 using RetroArch - They will use the 'PCSX ReARMed' core, more information on supported extensions here: [https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/](https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/)


## 5. Rescan to find your games

* Press 'Start' and go to 'Scan Settings', select your Adrenaline location, and if you are using custom game folders, select those too, then select 'Rescan'.
* Your retro games should now appear when you restart the app.
* 'Startup scan' can be turned off once you have finished adding your games, the app will startup faster when it's turned off.


## 6. Download covers & backgrounds

* To download cover images, press start, go to 'Artwork' then choose which covers or backgrounds you would like to download.
* From version 5 onwards you can also extract background images for PSP games from PSP iso files.
* If you add your own covers, rescan for them to be updated.
