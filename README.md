Windows users:

Please rename PSP ISO files using Leecherman's [PSP ISO Renamer tool](https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/PSPISORenamer) using the following parameters:

    %NAME% (%REGION%) [%ID%]

See the FAQ's section for a guide on [renaming on a mac](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher#im-on-a-mac-how-do-i-rename-psp-games).


More information on PSP and Playstation after the FAQ's section.

#### 3. Add your retro games to RetroFlow

Launch RetroFlow for the first time, RetroFlow will create the folders where you can save your games.

Once it's finshed loading; close RetroFlow and copy your favourite retro games into the relevant subfolders below:

    ux0:/data/RetroFlow/ROMS/

**Tip:**
It's important that your roms are named using the no-intro file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)" , otherwise cover images won't be found.


#### 4. Download covers

To download cover images, press start, then choose which covers you would like to download. 


# RetroFlow FAQ's

#### I'm on a Mac, how do I rename PSP games?
You can use the [UMD FileRenamer app here](https://github.com/BrosMakingSoftware/UMD_FileRenamer/releases/tag/v1.0)

Step 1. Rename using the tool
Open the 'UMD_FileRenamer-1.0.jar' file and select your folder of games, then rename.

Step 2. Rename using finder
In the finder, select all the games, right click and select 'rename items'.
Replace the opening and closing parenthesis with square brackets instead.

    Name (XXXX-XXXXX).iso

Will be renamed to:

    Name [XXXX-XXXXX].iso

The game names will be missing the region code, but it's not required for the RetroFlow to work.


#### Can I use HexFlow too?
Yes; RetroFlow is seperate, it uses different folders and a different title ID.

#### Do I need to create bubbles for games?
No; RetroFlow doesn't need bubbles for games.

#### How should I name my games so covers are found?
It's recommended that your roms are named using the no-intro file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)" , these names are used to match with cover images.

#### Some systems aren't showing?
Empty collections are hidden by default, once you add some games into the roms folder, they will appear.

#### Can I change the Mega Drive name to Genesis?
Sure; changing your language to 'English - American' will change the 'Mega Drive' name and logo to 'Genesis'.

#### Can I change a core for RetroArch?
The cores have been set by system and cannot be changed on a game-by-game basis at the moment.

To change the core for an entire system, search for "Retroarch Cores" in the file below and edit the core file names accordingly. 

    ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua

The RetroArch core files can be found here: "ux0:/app/RETROVITA/"

#### Can I change the rom folder locations?
The locations have been setup to keep things simple, if you would like to change the locations, search for "ROM Folders" in the 'index.lua' file below and edit accordingly.

    ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua

For example, to use the ux0 roms folder, the start of the section would look like

    -- ROM Folders
    local romFolder = "ux0:/Roms/"
    local romFolder_N64 = romFolder .. "Nintendo - Nintendo 64"



# Adding PSP and Playstation games

RetroFlow uses the game ID's for Playstation and PSP for cover matching.
Please use the guides below.

### PSP ###
For PSP ISO files please rename using Leecherman's [PSP ISO Renamer tool](https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/PSPISORenamer) using the following parameters:

    %NAME% (%REGION%) [%ID%]

The result should look like this:

    Cars 2 (US) [UCUS-98766].iso

RetroFlow uses the ID to match artwork, and tidies the rest of the filename to display in the app.

### Playstation ###
For PSX2PSP, game folder name must match with the GameID. For example:

    ux0:pspemu/PSP/GAME/**SLES01234**

Games will need to be in a EBOOT format, see here for information on [how to convert PSX Disc Images to EBOOT for PSP](https://www.cfwaifu.com/psx2psp/).
RetroFlow also uses the ID to lookup the name of the game.





# Custom Covers

Place your custom covers in "_ux0:/data/RetroFlow/COVERS/_"

Cover images must be in **png** format. For Vita, PSP and PSX games the The cover image file name must match the **App ID** or the **App Name** of each app. For roms the cover image name should match the **Rom Name** i.e. "Game Name (USA).png". The recommended resolution for Vita covers is 250x320px. [Sample image](https://live.staticflickr.com/7176/6885249717_738e8ee187_n.jpg)
