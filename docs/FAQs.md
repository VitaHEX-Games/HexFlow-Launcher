### Adrenaline - My games aren't working?
 * If Adrenaline games aren't launching, please install [Adrenaline Bubble Manager](https://github.com/ONElua/AdrenalineBubbleManager/releases). <br>
Or try installing [AdrBubbleBooterInstaller](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/307).
 * Check you have installed the 'RetroFlow Adrenaline Launcher' and that Adrenaline is functioning okay outside of RetroFlow.

<br><br>

### RetroArch fails to load games with "&" symbol in the game name
This appears to be an issue with RetroArch version 1.11 onward, try installing an [older version](https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/) of RetroArch until the issue is resolved.

<br><br>

<!--### PICO-8 games won't launch
Support for launchers was added after July 5, 2021. Please try a more current version of [FAKE-08](https://github.com/jtothebell/fake-08/releases). 

<br><br>-->

<!--### ScummVM some games won't launch
I found some games don't launch on ScummVM version 2.7.0, please try a previous version such as 2.6.1. Direct download link: [https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/2.6.1/scummvm-2.6.1-vita.vpk](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/2.6.1/scummvm-2.6.1-vita.vpk).

### Atari 5200 loads the memopad in RetroArch?
When the game is running in RetroArch bring up the RetroArch quick menu.

Go to 'Options > Atari System' and selected 5200.
Then go back one level and select 'Overrides > Save core overrides'.

The games should work provided you have everything else setup.

<br><br>

### Missing artwork - How should I name my games so covers are found?
It's recommended that your roms are named using the **no-intro** file naming convention, e.g. "Game Name (USA)", these names are used to match with cover images.

<br><br>

### Why is there no option to download homebrew covers?
Covers haven't been made for homebrew applications as it's not necessary as the app icon is used. If you move a homebrew game port into the Vita category you can download a cover if it's available. Vita style covers for homebrew applications won't be added, bt you can always add your own.

<br><br>

### How do I add disk based games?
 * PC Engine CD and TurboGrafx-CD - RetroFlow will look for '.cue' files for these CD systems. Please make sure all the games are loose with the system's game folder with .cue files.
 * Dreamcast - '.gdi' and '.cdi' games are supported.
 * PS1 using RetroArch - They will use the 'PCSX ReARMed' core, more information on supported extensions here: [https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/](https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/)

<br><br>

### PS1 and RetroArch, how do I set it up?
RetroArch Playstation 1 games use the 'PCSX ReARMed' core, more information on supported extensions and setup see here: [https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/](https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/)

<br><br>

### Can I set RetroFlow to launch when the Vita boots up?

If you want to auto-launch **RetroFlow Launcher** every time your PS Vita boots up you can use the [**AutoBoot**](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/info/261) plugin by Rinnegatamante. Please be careful using this app, use at your own risk. The title ID for RetroFlow is "RETROFLOW".

<br><br>

### Some systems aren't showing?
Empty collections are hidden by default, once you add some games into the game's folder, they will appear.

<br><br>

### Can I change a core for RetroArch?
The cores have been set by system and cannot be changed on a game-by-game basis.

To change the core for an entire system, search for "Retroarch Cores" in the file below and edit the core file names accordingly. `ux0:/app/RETROFLOW/index.lua`

The RetroArch core files can be found here: `ux0:/app/RETROVITA/`

<br><br>

### Can I change the game folder locations?
Yes, from version 4.0 onwards.
Go to 'Scan settings' and then 'Edit game directories' to change the path to game folders.

<br><br>

### Can I use HexFlow too?
Yes; RetroFlow is separate, it uses different folders and a different title ID.

<br><br>

### Do I need to create bubbles for games?
No; RetroFlow doesn't need bubbles for games.

<br><br>

### Can I change the Mega Drive name to Genesis?
Sure; changing your language to 'English - American' will change the 'Mega Drive' name and logo to 'Genesis'.
